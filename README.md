# TicTacToe_Python
A milestone project of a python bootcamp

Copyright (C) by Herbert Lam

This is a milestone project of a python bootcamp course. I spent around 3 hours to complete this project.

This project requires me to create a Tic-Tac-Toe app that allows two users to play the game. This is a good project for me to apply the python coding learnt in the course.

The game flow is shown as below:
1. The first player is asked to choose "X" or "O".
2. Both players are asked to confirm if they are ready to play.
3. Game starts!
4. During the game, the players can choose their desired position of the board same as the numeric keypad in computer.
5. When the game ends, players are asked to replay the game or not

The following key Python topics are used in the app:
- String manipulation and list indexing for displaying the Tic-Tac-Toe board
- Boolean variables for managing the game progress
- While loop for user input vaildation and game flow control
- For loop for executing a same method with 9 rounds
